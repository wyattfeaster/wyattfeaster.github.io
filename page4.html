		<h2> PARK SPOKANE - UX & UI </h2>

		<p class="contactinfo">
		This was our intern project over the coarse of the summer. We presented our work to the complany at the end of our internship.<br><br>

		<b>MY ROLE</b> <br>To create to user experience and user interface design. This included researching, userflows, wireframing, and prototyping. <br><br>
		<b>THE PROBLEM</b> <br>Finding somewhere to park in downtown Spokane without spending a fortune can be very hard. We wanted to create a site that would aid users in this quest.<br><br>
		<b>THE PROJECT</b><br>
		We began by doing research and gathering data on local parking gargages and lots in Spokane. We knew that we wanted to focus our attention on allowing the user to find the parking lots near their current location. With a mobile first approach, we wanted to ensure that the user could have their phones location service provide the information needed, while still allowing a manual address entry. One of our main goals was to allow the user to filter their results, based on price and location. We were able to achieve this through a dropdown filter. In addition to this we included a toggle between map and list view. We wanted the user to have to use as little effort as possible, so we enable to user to get directions via google maps as well as a street view photo. <br><br>
