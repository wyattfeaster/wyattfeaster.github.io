		<b>THE PROJECT</b><br>
		To improve the website of Eastern Washington Universities Bookstore both from a UX and UI perspective.<br><br>

			
		<b>THE PROBLEM</b><br>
		The bookstores website was not user friendly, was not responsive, and the site navigation from product pages to checkout was confusing to our users. These factors often resulted in cart abandonment partway through the process and low online sales. The bookstore also had a high bounce rate.
		<br><br>

		<b>THE RESEARCH</b><br>
		I did reasearch to figure out what factors may be leading the site to have high bounce rate, cart abandonment, and low time on pages. Students and alumni where also interviewed to see what the primary needs of our users was.<br><br>

				<strong><i>Major Research Findings</i></strong><br><br>
				More then 1/4th of online sales are done via mobile phones.<br><br>
				Having more then 5-6 items on the main navigation leads to customer frustration because of too many options.<br><br>
				The most common item users look for is textbooks.<br><br>
			
	
		<b>THE PROCESS</b><br>
		Once finding out that we needed to reduce the number of options presented to the user on our homepage, I worked with the information architecture for sometime and decided to reduce the number of options on our home navigation to just 5. All other options are accessible via dropdown menus.

		After figuring out the site structure, I moved into the user flow of our checkout experience. I focused my attention on ensuring that the user would not get confused or have to many unwanted steps. It was also important that the user had a sense of where in the checkout process they were.<br><br>

		<b>THE SOLUTION</b><br>
		Created a mobile friendly site, because that is very important to our users. I created a step by step check-out process that allows our users to see where in the checkout process they are. This allowed for a seamless checkout. I also presented the user with a order summary at the very end of the process in case they had made any errors. Once completing everything else I moved into wireframing, UI, and prototyping of the website for both desktop and mobile.<br>

		This project has been passed on and is currently under development.
