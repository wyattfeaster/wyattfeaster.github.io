		<b>THE PROBLEM</b><br>
		The bookstores website was not user friendly, was not responsive, and the site navigation from product pages to checkout was confusing to users. This often resulted in cart abandonment. In addition to this the site itself was not visually appealing.
		<br><br>
		<b>THE PROJECT</b><br>
		I took it upon myself to improve the UX and UI of the bookstores website. I began this by conducting reasearch on what helps to improve online checkout experiences as well as how to drive up online sales, which was ultimatly our goal. <br><br>
		I found out that we needed to reduce the number of options presented to the user on our homepage.Users do not want to bombared with options. I worked with the information arciteture for sometime and decided to reduced the number of options on our home navigation to just 5.<br><br>

		After figuring out the site structure, I moved into the user flow of our checkout experience. I focused my attention on ensuring that the user would not get confused or have to many unwanted steps. It was also important that the user had a sense of where in the checkout process they were.<br><br>

		Once completing everything else I moved into wireframing, UI, and protoyping of the website for both desktop and mobile.
