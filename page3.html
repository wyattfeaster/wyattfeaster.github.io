		<h2> DORITOS - UX & UI </h2>

		<b>THE PROJECT</b><br>
		This project was a concept that I complemented while interning at 14Four. Doritos and WB came to us and wanted to see what we could come up with for a code entry, that would entice users to enter codes on bags of Doritos. I knew that the users would have to be presented with a low barrier for entry, which is why the option to sig-up via facebook was included.<br><br> 

		The user flow was a very basic one. It only included profile set-up, choosing a side (whether that was Batman or Superman), code entry, and view progress. The goal was to create a more unique way for the user to choose their side, so having the user tap on the characters silhouette seemed more engageing then a 
		basic button.<br>

		With the short time frame we had, I sketched out some very surface level wireframes to brainstorm ideas about the design and layout.<br><br>
