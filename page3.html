		<h2> DORITOS - UX & UI </h2>

		<b>THE PROJECT</b><br>
		This project was a concept that I complemented while interning at 14Four. Doritos and WB came to us and wanted to see what we could come up with for a code entry, that would entice users to enter codes, off bags of Doritos. I knew that the user would have to be presented with a low barrier for entry, which made brought me to offer the user and option to signup for an account via their facebook.<br><br> 

		The user flow was a very basic one. I only included profile set-up, choosing a side 
		(whether that was Batman or Superman), code entry, and view progress. I wanted to create a more unique way for the user to select choose their side, so I decided to have them tap on the characters silhouette rather then a button.

		With the short time frame we had, I sketched out some very surface level wireframes to brainstorm ideas about the design and layout.<br><br>
