		<b>THE PROJECT</b><br>
		To design a website for a start-up company out of Spokane to specializes in shipping container homes.<br><br>

		<b>MY ROLE</b></br>
		Out of a group of 5 people my role was Art Director and lead of UX design. I directed a team of other designers through the creative proccess pushing the design in a modern and user friendly way. All web content was created by me. I also lead several UX workshops to teach the other student designers about the practice of UX.<br><br>

		<b>THE GOAL</b><br>
		 The major focus was to create a user friendly area on the site that allowed users to customize their own personal container home. We knew that this had to be simple, easy to use, and engaging. We were also were in charge of branding the company in a way that would be approriate for our customers.<br><br>

		<b>THE RESEARCH</b><br>
		We began our research by collecting information on our target users and determining what our users were looking for when customizing products. We did our fair share of digging to really understand our users. Once understanding our users better we couducted a few short interviews of the target demographic, 25-35 year olds.<br><br>

				<strong><i>Major Research Findings</i></strong><br><br>
				The designs had to be functional and have strong visual presence.<br><br>
				Many of the target users are busy and do not spend much time at home.<br><br>
				With many of the target users being considered to be hipsters, the small footprint of container homes appeals to them.<br><br>
			
	
		<b>THE PROCESS</b><br>
		Once we conducted our research we began to have collaberate group brainstorming sessions based on the information we had collected. We knew that we wanted to have to customiztion process the focus of our site. In order to acheive the best possible customization process we created personas and user scenarios.

		<strong><i>The Branding</i></strong><br><br>

		We then moved into working with the sites pages and information aritecture. We generated as many ideas as possible of what to include on the sites customization process and then begand to narrow it down to what was truly inportant. <br><br>

		<b>THE SOLUTION</b><br>
		In the end we created a website the way easy to use and limited the options of customization so that it would not overwhelm the user. We only included a select few options becuase we wanted to make the process short, sweet and painless. The site showcased the conatiner home throughout the entire process show to user could see their customizations in a live view.
