		<b>THE PROJECT</b><br>
		This project was to done for a client based out of spokane that specilizes in container homes. Our job was to produce a website and branding that met all of the needs of our customers.<br><br>

		<b>MY ROLE</b></br>
		Art director and head of UX. I was in charge of leading UX workshops to teach other student designers about the importance of UX. I also designed all web assets and pushed the branding in a modern sleek design.<br><br>

		<b>GOAL</b><br>
		Our primary objective was to create an engaging website that allows users to order and customize their own container homes. We set a major focus on ensuring that the user experience was quick, simple, and painless. <br><br>

		<b>RESEARCH</b><br>
		We began our research by collecting information on our target users and determining what our users were looking for when customizing products. We did our fair share of digging to really understand our users. Once understanding our users better we couducted a few short interviews of the target demographic, 25-35 year olds.<br><br>

				<strong><i>Major Research Findings</i></strong><br><br>
				The designs had to be functional and have strong visual presence.<br><br>
				Many of the target users are busy and do not spend much time at home.<br><br>
				With many of the target users being considered to be hipsters, the small footprint of container homes appeals to them.<br><br>


				<strong><i>Personas</i></strong><br><br>
				From the information we had gathered we developed personas to help us further undestand our users.<br><br>

		<b>PROCESS</b><br>  
		We began with branding the company. We knew that our logo was going to have equal importance to everything else. Our concept was you begin with you container and add your own personal elements to your container to create your Nooke. <br><br>

		<strong><i>Information Architecture</i></strong><br><br>
		Once we had completed the branding we did some work on the information architecture. We began with brainstorming as many elements as we could think of for the site and then narrowed it down to what was really needed.<br><br>

		After finishing up the site map we produced user flows to see how our users would navigate through the site and then created wireframes to lay the base for design.(Deliverables were created for wires, sitemap, user flows, and personas.)<br><br>

		<b>SOLUTION</b><br>
		In the end we created a website the way easy to use and limited the options of customization so that it would not overwhelm the user. We only included a select few options. The site showcased the conatiner home throughout the entire process so the user could see their customizations in a live view.<br><br>
